For this project, the goal was to use a python deep learning library and a database of song lyrics/genres to create a program that can write song lyrics.  
The length of the lyrics can be adjusted based on the desired amount of words.  The result was a program that is capable of making songs with a roughly 80%
chance of being a coherent song, with the other 20% not being comprehensible
